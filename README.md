# Pylias
Automated download of all your files at Ilias-HHN.
## Description
Pylias is a Selenium based automation for the Ilias of Hochschule Heilbronn.

This tool downloads all your files from your courses without having to create directories on your own to manage the downloaded files. 

You can either specify a individual download-path or use the default download-directory within this project.
My advise would be to use a empty directory to beginn with, because otherwise the files of the selected download-path 
will be moved to the newly created "content"-directory. This "content"-directory will be in your selected download-path.
